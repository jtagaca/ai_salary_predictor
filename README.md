## About

AI Salary Predictor is an AI model that can predict employee salaries based on their years of experience.

## Context

This AI model can predict employee salaries based on their years of experience. This uses a data set that includes two fields: years of experience and salary. Years of experience is an independent variable, whereas salary depends on years of experience. This demonstrates that the higher the salary, the more employee experience. To make the model, we split the data set then a linear regression model is made used to predict the salary. In addition, we run a polynomial regression model on the data to better expect the salary.
