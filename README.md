## About

AI Salary Predictor is an AI model that can predict employee salaries based on their years of experience.

## Context

This AI model makes use of a data set that includes two fields: years of experience and salary. Years of experience is an independent variable, whereas salary is dependent on years of experience. This demonstrates that the more employee experience someone has, the higher their salary will be. To create the model, we split the data set and then created a linear regression model to predict the salary. In addition, we run a polynomial regression model on the data to better predict the salary.
